# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and Machine Learning.  
This project demonstrates handling imbalanced data, feature analysis, and predictive modeling.

## 🏦 Business Problem
Banks lose billions each year to fraud. Detecting fraud early protects both customers and the bank.  

## 🎯 Goal
- Identify fraudulent transactions with high recall.  
- Provide actionable insights for fraud prevention.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data Visualization)  

## 📝 Approach
1. Load and explore dataset  
2. Handle imbalanced data  
3. Train ML models  
4. Evaluate using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC  
5. Provide business insights  

## 📊 Key Highlights
- Built models achieving high fraud detection recall  
- Visualized fraud patterns and transaction trends  
- Applied SMOTE to improve model performance
