## 📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are a major concern in the financial sector, leading to billions in annual losses. Detecting fraud in real-time is essential to protect both organizations and customers.

In this project, I built and evaluated machine learning models to classify transactions as **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**. I compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, and achieved **near-perfect performance** on the dataset.

   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00    170589
weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00    170589
```

* **Accuracy:** \~100%
* **Very low misclassification rate** (only 92 out of 170k transactions)

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Validate performance on **real-world, larger datasets**
* Implement a **real-time fraud detection pipeline**
* Experiment with **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTM, Autoencoders)
* Deploy using **Flask / FastAPI + Streamlit dashboard**

---

## 🏆 Key Takeaways

* Machine learning models (especially XGBoost) are highly effective in fraud detection.
* Metrics like **precision & recall** are more meaningful than accuracy alone when dealing with fraud.
* This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow: preprocessing → training → evaluation → interpretation.
